# Even-s-Birthday-Present

This is my gift for my internet friend Even! Happy b-day!!

## Contents

The first section contains all my favourite paid html/bootstrap responsive templates. I actually haven't used them all. Below I will list all of 
them (so I don't forget to do it lol)

### Templates

1. [Baikal](http://demo.themewagon.com/preview/bootstrap-4-startup-small-business-website-template)
2. [Canvas](https://themeforest.net/item/canvas-the-multipurpose-html5-template/9228123?s_rank=1) 
3. [Avada](https://avada.theme-fusion.com/)
4. [Elixir](https://themewagon.com/themes/elixir-elegant-html5-bootstrap-template-consultancy-agency-website/)
5. [Posh](https://themewagon.com/themes/posh-html5-bootstrap-4-template/)

Editor's note - Canvas is one of my favourite ones tbh, I hope you like it. I was actually planning on doing something like it for Altitude.

Editor's note pt. 2 - Avada is the most selling WordPress template ever, and I actually have an HTML template version, so hmu if you want it.
### Help w/ Xcode

So I know you really enjoy and are very good at web development and online coding but I also know you're not that good at iOS native development so I decided to help you out a bit (I hope you don't think I'm rude lol)

- [Introduction to iOS 11 Development: Swift 4 and Xcode 9](https://www.udemy.com/ios11development/)
- [Your first Swift 4 and iOS 11 App](https://www.raywenderlich.com/3990-your-first-swift-4-ios-11-app/lessons/1)

Well, that's all really hope you like it. You are allowed to share this link if you feel like it. Just make sure to credit me lol. Also, lots of lols I've used there, haven't I?
Cya later Even,
