This folder contains all my favourite paid html/bootstrap responsive templates. I actually haven't used them all. Below I will list all of them (so I don't forget to do it lol);
1. [Baikal](http://demo.themewagon.com/preview/bootstrap-4-startup-small-business-website-template)
2. [Canvas](https://themeforest.net/item/canvas-the-multipurpose-html5-template/9228123?s_rank=1) 
3. [Avada](https://avada.theme-fusion.com/)

Editor's note - Canvas is one of my favourite ones tbh, I hope you like it. I was actually planning on doing something like it for Altitude.

Editor's note pt. 2 - Avada is the most selling WordPress template ever, and I actually have an HTML template version, so hmu if you want it.
